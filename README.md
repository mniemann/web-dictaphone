Audio Memos

Audio Memos is a FireFox OS app to record short memos on one's phone.

Usage is straight forward.

Press the red button to record. Press the same button (now the stop button) to stop. Enter a name for the clip, to save it.

The list of saved clips appears below the record button. Tap a clip title to see the audio player. Tab the delete button to delete the clip.

Thanks.
Thanks to Chris Mills for the Web Dictaphone sample app which served as the inspiration.
Thanks also to Robert Nybert for his [article] (http://css.dzone.com/articles/blobs-and-more-storing-images) on storing blobs in indexedDB.

Without either of those great code sources, I would not have been able to create this app.

Finally thanks to [Sole](http://soledadpenades.com/) for the oscilloscope code.
